    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely, a \"content\" image (C) and a \"style\" image (S), to create a \"generated\" image (G). The generated image G combines the \"content\" of the image C with the \"style\" of image S.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you are going to generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how you can do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Transfer Learning\n",
    "Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the original NST paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we will use the VGG network. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).\n",

For clarity, note that $a^{(C)}$ and $a^{(G)}$ are the volumes corresponding to a hidden layer's activations. In order to compute the cost $J_{content}(C,G)$, it might also be convenient to unroll these 3D volumes into a 2D matrix, as shown below.

    "Neural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image\n",
    "It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet.\n",
    "The content cost function is computed using one hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "The style cost function for one layer is computed using the Gram matrix of that layer's activations. The overall style cost function is obtained using several hidden layers.\n",
    "Optimizing the total cost function results in synthesizing new images.\n",
    "This was the final programming exercise of this course. Congratulations--you've finished all the programming exercises of this course on Convolutional Networks! We hope to also see you in Course 5, on Sequence models!\n",

    "The Neural Style Transfer algorithm was due to Gatys et al. (2015). Harish Narayanan and Github user \"log0\" also have highly readable write-ups from which we drew inspiration. The pre-trained network used in this implementation is a VGG network, which is due to Simonyan and Zisserman (2015). Pre-trained weights were from the work of the MathConvNet team.\n",
